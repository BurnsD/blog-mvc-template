  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  Want to limit the time of setting up your new blog project? That's exactly why I have set up this template. Using a MVC file structure you can manipulate all file names within to coorelate to your own project. All files are empty and named in a way to fit a basic blog. 
   
  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
  Just simply clone this repo and start your project! All files come without code. (This is a template not a functioning application)
